GAME OVER
The Day of Reckoning
Congratulations! You've achieved the game objective!
You haven't reached the game objective!
You've tried to fool the programmers with some cheeky key press combinations!
You've successfully run a Holiday Island business for sixty years!
You've successfully made it through the tutorial scenario, now you're ready to try your hand at a proper game.
You've earned enough money.
Enough holiday makers came to Holiday Island.
You've now ousted all the competition.
The "high society" folk are enchanted.
Let's go surfin' now...
Sustainable tourism on Holiday Island.
You've gone bankrupt.
Try the tutorial scenario again, but this time pay a little more attention to your cash.
You haven't managed to earn £200,000,000 over 20 years.
The 10,000 holiday makers didn't arrive in the twentieth year.
The competition also hasn't been sleeping for those 20 years.
After 30 years, your island still hasn't gained enough acceptance with the rich and the beautiful.
After 10 years the longed-for surfers paradise still hasn't happened.
After 20 years tourism still isn't sustainable.
Your property is
£.
